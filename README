Introduction
================================================================================

This is a work-in-progress driver for vfs301 usb device 138a:0005 (and maybe 
also other compatible ones - vfs300/451 perhaps?).

As of now only a very basic command-line utility is ready, developed using
stuff captured under Windows 7/x64.

I didn't really reverse-engineer the protocol too much yet, so there is much
space for improvement:
* simplify the messages definitions (esp. the repeating sequences)
* check which messages are really required
* check how to blink the white/orange LEDs for wait/success/failure 
  notifications
* check how to properly prepare the scaner to wait for new finger (instead of
  returning the noise half the time)
* check how to detect which part of the scanned data is the fingeprint
* the received data are highly distrorted depending on speed of finger - find
  some way to normalize it (or will libfprint do it?)

Distributable under GPLv2 or later.



How to use
================================================================================

Currently only commandline utility is available - libfprint integration is 
planned after major problems are dealt with and the code is cleaned up.


Requirements:
libusb-1.0


Build & run:
cd proto
make
./proto
Ctrl+C
Ctrl+Z
kill %

...yes, it's a bit flakey (wasn't really in mood yet to do it properly:-))

It should spit out a few scan_*.pgm files in the current directory. The makefile
also sets up the access rights to the usb device.
