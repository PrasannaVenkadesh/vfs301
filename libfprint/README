Copy the files libfprint/vfs301.c cli/vfs301_*.* from this driver directory to 
the libfprint directory libfprint/drivers (just files, not into subdirectories).
Apply the patch libfprintf/integrate_vfs301.patch to the libfprint sources.

Then just do ./autogen.sh and make - and the examples/enroll and examples/verify
utilities should do stuff :-)
